    "\n",
    "Q: Overall, which artist has the higher average sentiment per song? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Looking at the results above, Cher had an average sentiment score of 3.16 and Robyn has a score of 2.02. Cher has the higher average sentiment per song compared to Robyn. This is based on lyrics analyzed using the lexicons for positive and negative words. Cher's songs' on average, tend to convey a more positive sentiment according to the lexicon-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For your first artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: My first artist is Cher and the three songs that have the highest sentiments are: \"Love and Understanding\", \"Perfection\", and \"My Love\". The words associated with these three songs envoke happiness, love, and positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three songs with the lowest sentiments are: \"Dressed to Kill\", \"Outrageous\", and \"I Walk on Guilded Splinters\". These songs include words that are associated sadness, anger, or negativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment score is mostly driven by the presence of words in the sentiment lexicon (positive, negative, or neutral). The lexicon assigns scores based on how each word is perceived emotionally.The sentiment score reflects the overall emotional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For your second artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A. My second artist is Robyn, whos three songs with the highest sentiments are \"Love is Free\", \"Indestructible\", and \"U should know better\". The three songs with the lowest sentiments are \"Criminal Intent\", \"Don't Fucking tell me what to do\" and an extended version of the same song. I believe the strong emotional tone and content is driving the sentiment score. Words such as 'love' and 'free' repeated in the song Love Is Free. In the song Indestructible there are phrases such as \"your love is ultramagnetic\". It also provides an insight into past mistakes when it talks about \"I let the bad ones in and the good ones go\". The lower sentiment songs revolve around criminal intent, complaints and frustrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Plot the distributions of the sentiment scores for both artists. You can use `seaborn` to plot densities or plot histograms in matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Please see the plot below.\n",
